Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of making and improving computer programs. It is important because it helps businesses run smoothly, keeps data safe, and allows people to connect and use technology easily.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.	1950s – Early Programming – Coding was done in machine language, making development slow.
	2.	1968 – Software Engineering Introduced – Addressed software project failures.
	3.	2001 – Agile Manifesto – Introduced flexible and fast development methods.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.	Planning – Define project goals.
	2.	Analysis – Gather requirements.
	3.	Design – Create software structure.
	4.	Development – Write the code.
	5.	Testing – Fix errors and ensure quality.
	6.	Deployment – Release for use.
	7.	Maintenance – Update and fix issues.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall – Step-by-step, no changes (e.g., banking systems).
	•	Agile – Flexible, fast updates (e.g., mobile apps).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
•	Software Developer – Writes and tests code.
	•	QA Engineer – Ensures software quality.
	•	Project Manager – Oversees project progress.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
•	IDEs – Help write and test code (e.g., Visual Studio).
	•	VCS – Tracks code changes (e.g., Git).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines – Use time management.
	•	Debugging Errors – Use debugging tools.
	•	Keeping Up with Tech – Learn continuously.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.	Unit Testing – Tests small code parts.
	2.	Integration Testing – Ensures parts work together.
	3.	System Testing – Checks full software.
	4.	Acceptance Testing – Verifies user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing clear and specific instructions to get the best responses from AI models. It is important because well-structured prompts improve accuracy, efficiency, and relevance in AI-generated answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
•	Vague Prompt: Tell me about technology.
	•	Improved Prompt: Explain how artificial intelligence is used in self-driving cars.

Why is the improved prompt better?
It is clear (focuses on AI), specific (self-driving cars), and concise (no unnecessary words), ensuring a more useful and relevant response.
